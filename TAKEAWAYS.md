Docker can be use as a dev env of in which a script is run (only requirements.txt and dependencies included, no source code). In other words, the container is not a standalone microapplication. Docker can be also used as a standalone microapplication.
When docker containers run independently or jointly (with docker-compose), they run on the local machine, no cloud.
